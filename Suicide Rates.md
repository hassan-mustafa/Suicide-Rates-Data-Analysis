## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that there was a modifying effects from the Sex,
Age on the Suicides rates. The relationship between Gdp per capita and Suicides rates percentage seems to be uncorrelated although countries with high Gpd recorded higher suicides/100K percentages for all age groups and sexes. Also, there's a clear trend of decreased percentages of
Suicides/100K across years.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the effect of age and sex on Suicides/100K percentages also and the effect of GDP on it. I start by introducing the distrubution of suicides/100K percentages. Then visulaizing the distuibtion of Suicides/100L again for variables like age and sex. plotting them by box plot.
In the end of the presentation, I give a clear visualization of higher/lower 10 countries in mean Gdp, showing the suicides/100K for all sexes and ages. 
Also presenting the change of mean suicides/100K percentages across year by scatter plot.
